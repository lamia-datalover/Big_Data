This PySpark code is designed to manipulate and transform deeply nested JSON data into a structured DataFrame format. It performs several steps to load data from an S3 bucket, explode nested structures, and flatten the schema to make data analysis more straightforward. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the goal of this code: <br>
<b>Goal of the Code</b><br>
The primary goal is to simplify the analysis of complex nested JSON data by transforming it into a flat, structured DataFrame. This is particularly useful for handling data where each JSON object contains multiple levels of nested information, common in API responses or data feeds like YouTube song data.<br>
<br>
<b>Steps Breakdown</b><br>
<b>Loading Data:</b><br>

The JSON file is loaded from an AWS S3 bucket into a PySpark DataFrame using the multiline=True option to correctly handle multi-line JSON.<br>
<br>
<b>Initial Exploration and Transformation:</b><br>

Print the initial schema to understand the structure of the nested JSON.<br>
Use the explode function to flatten the 'items' array, which likely contains individual song records, into a new DataFrame items_df. This transformation results in one song per row, simplifying further operations.<br>
<br>
<b>Schema Inspection and Flattening:</b><br>

Display the schema again to verify changes and better understand deeper nested structures.<br>
Implement a custom function walkSchema that recursively explores the schema and generates full path names for each leaf node. This is useful for accessing nested fields directly.<br>
Print and explore various aspects of the JSON schema to understand its structure better, focusing on keys such as 'type' and 'fields'.
<br>
<b>Column Manipulation:</b><br>
- Dynamically generate column paths using the `walkSchema` function and use these paths to create new columns in the DataFrame. This step effectively flattens the schema, turning nested JSON fields into direct DataFrame columns.<br>
<br>
<b>Final Structuring:</b><br>
- Use the `reduce` function in conjunction with `withColumn` to iteratively apply transformations across all generated column paths, adding them to the DataFrame.<br>
- Drop the original 'items' column as it's redundant after extraction.<br>
<br>
<b>Resulting DataFrame:</b><br>
- The final DataFrame, `exploded_df`, is a flattened version of the original nested structure, making it much easier to perform data analysis and manipulation. It's displayed as a Pandas DataFrame to visualize the changes.<br>
